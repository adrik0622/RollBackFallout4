This is a basic script that automates rolling back of fallout4 data files on my ubuntu system based on this guide that was found here

Alright everyone I have figured out how to downgrade everything to the previous version.

Firstly, you'll need this guide.

https://framedsc.com/GeneralGuides/steam_update_guide.htm

Follow it cause you need to learn how to download the repositories and how to open the steam console. Once you got that down you have to download these and install them in order replacer EVERYTHING whenever it is needed.

(Keep in mind that you are re-downloading the game from what has been saved in STEAMDB, do it one by one, don't hog your download speed by trying to do it all at once. File size should be about 22-ish GBs once you have everything. Once again FOLLOW the guide so you know where the repos will be downloaded and where / how you'll want to move them around.)

Once that is done you have to delete most new files from the creation club that will be in your DATA, these are the culprits that will cause your game to crash since Bethesda updated them in masse I can't be sure which one is safe to keep and which one isn't, so for now it is best to put them in a Back Up folder. Now, anything that has "ccBG" at the beginning of its name in the DATA folder should be safe to remove, that is the code they give to creation club content, however, if you use mods, you probably already know that these are not very much compatible with anything extra from nexus you add to the game.

Once you have all that done REMEMBER to play the game in offline mode / to shut off wi-fi on your steam deck (as is my case) or to delete any manifesto that will force the game to update, cause it will break everything again. Once you have everything I stated done you can probably re-install the current (non-updated) version of the Script Extender and start playing. I've not encountered any crashes or data corruptions. Save games seem clean enough that I have no missing ESP / ESL / Meshes / Textures. If anything goes wrong or you don't feel confident enough that this won't screw your fallout 4 install folder then don't try it. For MO2 this should be safe enough since mods are kept separately from the game elsewhere.

@ianpatt if you could pin this so people know not to bother you it would be great.
